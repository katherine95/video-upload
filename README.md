####Want to Join the Development Team?

This app was created using thenewboston API which is currently in development. As of now, we are restricting API access to limited users only. You may [send me a message](https://www.thenewboston.com/profile.php?user=2) if you would like a developer key.

####How to Setup with Android Studio

1 - You first need a developer key for thenewboston's API. This key will identify you as a developer and also allow you to access all video data on our server. To obtain a developer key you can [send me a message here.](https://www.thenewboston.com/profile.php?user=2)


2 - You will also need a YouTube Android Player API key from Google to allow your app to play YouTube videos. [Register for a YouTube Android Player API Key from here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/register)

3 - Once you have both keys, copy this link: https://github.com/buckyroberts/thenewboston-Videos-Android-App.git

4 - From Android Studio, choose the “Check out project from Version Control” option.
